# MiniTorch Module 0

Welcome to the foundational module of MiniTorch! This assignment introduces you to the core concepts and tools you'll use throughout the course.

## Learning Objectives

In this assignment, you will:

- **Implement mathematical operators** using functional programming principles
- **Learn software engineering best practices** including testing, debugging, and code organization
- **Build neural network infrastructure** by creating the foundational components
- **Create and visualize classifiers** to understand machine learning fundamentals

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before beginning this assignment, please complete the environment setup:

1. **Review the installation guide**: Follow the detailed instructions in [`installation.md`](installation.md) to configure your development environment
2. **Verify your setup**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and your environment is working correctly. If you need help ask your TAs.

### Assignment Overview

This module provides hands-on experience with the mathematical foundations underlying neural networks. You'll implement core operations that form the building blocks of more complex machine learning systems.

### Submission Instructions

1. **Commit Your Changes**: Make sure all your changes are committed to your repository.
2. **Push to GitHub**: Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
3. **Autograder**: Once you have pushed your changes, the autograder will automatically run and provide feedback on your submission. Check the GitHub Actions tab for the results.
4. **Resubmit if Necessary**: If you need to make changes based on the feedback, make your edits, commit them, and push again. The autograder will re-run with your new changes.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the submission process, consider the following steps:

- **Check the Logs**: Review the logs in the GitHub Actions tab for any error messages or warnings.
- **Check Instruction in Code**: Make sure you followed all instructions in the code comments and documentation.
- **Ask for Help**: If you're stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to your TAs.
